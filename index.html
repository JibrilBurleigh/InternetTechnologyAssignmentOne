	<h2>Welcome to My Home Page</h2>

		<pre>
			My name is Jibril Burleigh. I am currently a student at Claflin University.
			This actually is not my first webpage. I have made a couple of unpublished 
			ones before, though I was <strong><em>very</em></strong> bad at finishing them.Hopefully, I will become
			 better at it in the future. I need to use a q tag now, so....

	<p>Here is a quote from Wikipedia, about Wikipedia</p>

			Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia on January 15, 2001. Sanger[9] coined its name, a portmanteau of wiki and encyclopedia. Initially only in English, Wikipedia quickly became multilingual as it developed similar versions in other languages, which differ in content and in editing practices. The English Wikipedia is now one of 291 Wikipedia editions and is the largest with 5,058,654 articles (having reached 5,000,000 articles in November 2015). There is a grand total, including all Wikipedias, of over 38 million articles in over 250 different languages.As of February 2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month.
